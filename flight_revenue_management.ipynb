    "The dataset provides the actual sales data for the months of June 2019 and a partial of August 2019. It includes information on:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Flight Numbers** (e.g., TR 202, TR 203)\n",
    "- **Seat Capacity** for each flight (180 max)\n",

    "# Time-Series Forecasting Method\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, a time-series model was applied to the data to predict the AverageFare (SGD) and SeatsSold for specific flights throughout August 2019. Unlike regression models, time-series forecasting inherently accounts for the sequential nature of data, making it more suitable for predicting outcomes that are influenced by temporal factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PyCaret time-series model used here was trained on historical data, capturing trends, seasonality, and other time-dependent patterns that influence flight sales and pricing. This approach aims to provide more accurate and reliable predictions compared to traditional regression methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Points**\n",
    "- **Time Dependence**: The time-series model accounts for the sequential order of data, recognizing that past values influence future outcomes. This is critical for making accurate predictions in industries where trends and seasonality significantly impact demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Seasonality and Trend Analysis**: The model captures both seasonal effects (e.g., weekly or monthly patterns) and long-term trends, providing a more comprehensive forecast that aligns with real-world behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Improved Accuracy**: By incorporating temporal patterns and using a more extensive dataset, the time-series model offers potentially more accurate predictions for seat sales and fares, especially in dynamic environments like the airline industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Complexity**: Time-series models are typically more complex and require a deeper understanding of the underlying data. However, this complexity allows for more nuanced predictions that better reflect reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensive Data Utilization**: The model benefits from a more extensive historical dataset, allowing it to better capture the variations and trends over time, leading to more reliable forecasting."

    "## **Could The Regression Model Truly Predict the Remaining Seats to be Sold in August 2019?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **not really**. While the model provides predictions based on historical data and other features, it's essential to understand that there are limitations:\n",
    "\n",
    "**predicted_regress**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataframe shows the regression model predictions for flight TR202 and TR203:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Fare Predictions (Based on AverageFare(SGD))**:\n",
    "   - The predicted fare generally varies within a range of SGD 51 to SGD 68, with most values clustering between SGD 53 and SGD 57. This suggests that the model expects the average fare to stay relatively stable throughout the month, with a slight increase on August 20th, possibly due to anticipated higher demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Seats Predictions (Based on SeatsSold)**:\n",
    "   - The seat predictions in this column consistently hover around 4 to 5, which seems to be an unusual representation if it indicates actual numbers of seats sold. Given that this value is low, it might suggest that the model is predicting in terms of blocks of seats or uses a scaling factor that isn’t directly interpretable as the actual number of seats. Alternatively, this could be an error or misinterpretation in the prediction results.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Fare Predictions (Based on WeightedAverageFare(SGD))**:\n",
    "   - The weighted average fare predictions show even less variability than the average fare, almost consistently predicting SGD 49.0 across all dates, with only minor deviations (SGD 48 or SGD 50 on a few dates). This suggests the model assumes a stable pricing strategy that doesn’t fluctuate much with expected demand or other variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Seats Predictions (Based on TotalSeatsSold)**:\n",
    "   - The total seats sold predictions are fairly consistent, with most values around 170 to 172. These values align more closely with the seat capacity of the airplane (180 seats) and suggest that the model expects near-full occupancy for most flights.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Insights**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Model Consistency**:\n",
    "   - The model shows a high level of consistency in its predictions, especially for weighted average fare and total seats sold. This could indicate that the model is built on a stable, non-volatile dataset where prices and seat sales don’t vary much day-to-day.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Potential Model Limitations**:\n",
    "   - The low variation in fare predictions (particularly in the weighted average) and the somewhat confusing low seat predictions based on seats sold suggest that the model might be oversimplifying its predictions. It might not be fully capturing the day-to-day fluctuations that are typical in airline sales, such as those caused by promotional activities, holidays, or other demand spikes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus on Full Occupancy**:\n",
    "   - The prediction for total seats sold hovering near 171-172 indicates that the model expects the flight to operate near full capacity consistently. This is a good sign in terms of operational efficiency, as it implies that most flights are expected to be fully booked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this dataframe provides a stable and somewhat conservative outlook on flight TR202's performance throughout August 2019, with predictions suggesting consistent pricing and near-full capacity for each flight. However, the lack of variability in the predictions raises questions about the model's ability to adapt to sudden changes in market conditions."

    "## **Could The Time-Series Model Truly Predict the Remaining Seats to be Sold in August 2019?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is **it's better than the regression model**. Here’s why:\n",
    "\n",
    "**predicted_ts**\n",
    "\n",
    "This dataframe shows the time-series model predictions for flight TR202 and TR203:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For TR202 predictions**:\n",
    "   - The model did not detect sufficient variability or patterns in the historical data used for training, leading it to predict the same `AverageFare`, `WeightedAverageFare`, and `TotalSeatsSold` for all dates in August 2019. This could be addressed by incorporating more diverse and extensive historical data, adjusting the model parameters, or considering different preprocessing techniques to better capture any underlying trends or patterns in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **For TR203 predictions**:\n",
    "   - Unlike the predictions for TR202 (`predictions_202`), which were static, these predictions exhibit a dynamic range, indicating that the model detected and accounted for underlying trends and fluctuations in the data. The observed fluctuations in `SeatsSold` and fare-related metrics reflect the model's sensitivity to underlying trends and external influences, making it a potentially valuable tool for forecasting in the airline industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "   However, ongoing evaluation and refinement are necessary to ensure the model's continued relevance and accuracy in a highly dynamic market.\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Overbooking Scenario**:\n",
    "     - It must be made known that the airplane used has a seat limit of 180. The model predicts that the number of seats bought could exceed this limit due to an increasing trend in demand. Is this necessarily a good or bad thing for overbooking a plane?\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Good Scenario**: If the model is accurately predicting a realistic overbooking scenario, where the actual number of passengers who show up will still fall within the 180-seat limit, this can be a good strategy for maximizing revenue. In this case, the model helps the airline optimize its booking strategy by filling as many seats as possible, even accounting for potential no-shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "     - **Bad Scenario**: If the model overestimates the number of no-shows, leading to predictions that consistently exceed the 180-seat limit without sufficient no-shows to balance out, this could result in too many passengers showing up. The airline would then face the challenges of overbooking, such as needing to compensate bumped passengers and handling customer dissatisfaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Additional Insights**\n",
    "- **Impact of Market Dynamics**:\n",
    "   - The model's ability to predict varying outcomes suggests it may be sensitive to changes in market dynamics, such as competitor pricing, macroeconomic conditions, or unexpected events. This adaptability is beneficial, but it also means that the model must be closely monitored and recalibrated as market conditions evolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "In conclusion, while the time-series model shows improvements over the regression model, particularly in detecting trends and variability, careful consideration is needed when applying these predictions, especially regarding overbooking practices."

    "### **Regression Model**\n",
    "While the regression model provides a reasonable estimate based on the available data, the predictions might not accurately reflect the reality of seat sales in August 2019 due to its limitations in handling time-dependent factors. Additionally, the limited dataset (only June 2019) further constrains the model's ability to make accurate predictions. \n",
    "\n",
    "For more accurate forecasting, especially in the airline industry where demand fluctuates based on numerous time-dependent factors, a dedicated time-series model, combined with more extensive historical data, could provide more reliable results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Time-Series Model**\n",
    "The time-series model offers a more accurate approach to predicting seat sales, but its effectiveness is directly tied to the quality and quantity of the historical data available. A model trained on a robust dataset that includes multiple years of data will likely outperform one that is limited to a shorter time frame. This is because long-term patterns, such as year-over-year trends, can be crucial in making accurate predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the model is not without its challenges. Time-series forecasting can be complex and may require fine-tuning to adjust to sudden changes in the market, such as economic downturns, unexpected events, or changes in customer behavior. Additionally, the model may need to be regularly updated with new data to maintain its accuracy over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, while the prediction of exceeding 180 seats could indicate a proactive strategy to maximize revenue, it also highlights the importance of closely monitoring the actual show-up rates and being prepared with contingency plans to manage any potential overbooking fallout.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Remarks**\n",
    "It is also important to note that no fine-tuning was done to either model, which could prove vital in providing even better results."
